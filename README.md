# Centralized-Context-Aware-Firewall
This project is a centralized network security tool that functions similarly to a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** system. It was designed to address the limitations of standalone firewalls by centralizing threat intelligence and providing real-time visibility into network traffic.
